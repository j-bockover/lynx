                  himself in his passion for science to avoid the taunts and
                  threats of his fellow classmates and stumbled into a world
                  beyond his imagining. While visiting a public exhibition of
                  new breakthroughs in radiation manipulation and genetics,
                  Parker felt the bite of a common house spider exposed to a
                  particle beam and felt immediately ill from it, little
                  realizing how much his life would change in the coming hours.

                  On the way home, the teenager unconsciously avoided a wayward
                  automobile by making an incredible leap to the wall of a
                  nearby building, finding himself miraculously able to stick to
                  it by his hands and feet. Quickly realizing he had somehow
                  acquired the abilities of a spider, he began testing his
                  new-found powers and marveled at their width and breadth.
                  Parker tested his spider abilities in the ring of a local
                  wresting competition and, wearing a mask to hide his identity,
                  easily bested the reigning champion.

                  Parker, an orphan, lived with his kindly Aunt May and Uncle
                  Ben and was wary of exposing them to the public scrutiny that
                  would surely ensue if he revealed his powers to the world, so
                  he adopted a suitable costume and the name of “Spider-Man” to
                  hide his true identity. He also designed and crafted two
                  wrist-worn “web-shooters” to approximate a spider’s
                  web-spinning capability, and with them swiftly became a smash
                  television personality. Now with money to take care of his
                  guardians and acclaim to salve puny Peter Parker’s wounds from
                  classmates, the young man grew cold to everything but his
                  media-darling career.

                  allowed a burglar to escape police arrest during a Spider-Man
                  appearance rather than intervene. Later, when he returned
                  home, he learned of his Uncle Ben’s murder at the hands of the
                  very same burglar and instantly felt the weight of hubris upon
                  his young shoulders. Vowing never to use his powers again for
                  his own gain, he tracked down his uncle’s killer as Spider-Man
                  and brought him to justice. From that moment on, he abandoned
                  his media star persona and spun his web solely to capture
                  criminals of all kinds.

                  Spider-Man an edge in his battles that often times defies

                  are his web-shooters. Strapped to both his wrists and
                  activated by finger pressure applied to touch pads on his
                  palms, the shooters can spray a unique fluid of the hero’s
                  creation which solidifies to various thicknesses upon exposure
                  to air and form into “webbing.” The tensile strength of the

                  shooters, but at its peak can stop a large vehicle and also
